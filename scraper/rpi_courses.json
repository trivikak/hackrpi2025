In the 20th century, the movements of Cubism, Futurism, Neo-Plasticism, Constructivism, Purism, Surrealism, and Dadaism consisted of dynamic dialogs between architecture and painting. These exchanges allowed each to have a profound and deep impact upon the other. By contrast, in early 21st century, there seems to be all but a mute relationship between the two. This course intends to help break that silence. This course will begin to bridge the divide by establishing new connections between the current preoccupations with materials, procedures, and affects that are emerging in both contemporary painting and architecture. Twisted Siblings seeks to explore and discover new relationships between the most cutting-edge digital technologies and how painting may influence the expressive capacities of these technologies. As contemporary painting and architecture seek to establish future directions, a new dialog and exchange of ideas should be emerging, to ensure a dynamic and radical future for both. The course will consist of a series of lectures, discussions, and presentations. Students will be expected to research a number of individual architects, painters, and writers who are producing work of related interest. Students will be responsible for completing a research project, which synthesizes the content of the course.",

First, students will learn the basics of digital signal processing, develop an understanding of measurement equipment and analysis methods for sound. The course will examine the ISO standards of room-acoustic measurements, develop students\u2019 research goals and a specific set of data to gather for their research. The course will also prepare the students with the fundamental knowledge on CATT Acoustic and/or EASE in geometrical modeling. Then the students and professors will visit a number of performance venues (e.g. EMPAC Concert Hall, and/ or other venues) and perform the room-acoustic measurements. Students will then work on analyzing and interpreting the research results. Practice measurements will be scheduled in the gallery or somewhere on campus before trips to performance halls. MATLAB will play a central role throughout all the classes (SRL I & II) and the thesis research projects. It will be used during the class exercises . Within one week from the semester start, every student is required to INSTALL a functioning MATLAB Software package onto their laptop computer. B.S. and B. ARCH, and other school students can only register for the 4000 level of this course and M.S. in ARCS students must register only for the 6000 level of this course.",

The course will also give students a deeper theoretical understanding of architectural acoustics in order to assist them in room acoustics research. There will also be labs to reflect typical measurement procedures and (if time permits) site visits to acoustics research labs and different types of acoustical spaces.

Each year, the course has a theme. The theme for this year is quantum cognition, which applies quantum theory in cognitive modeling. This course is designed as self-contained, and has no prerequisites. A middle term presentation and a final term paper are required for each student. Graduate students only.",

Cognitive modeling is the simulation of human cognitive, perceptual, and motor processes based on a cognitive architecture. The benefit of cognitive modeling is that it facilitates the testing of ideas about human processes through comparison of model data with empirical data. This course covers ACT-R, a symbolic architecture and LEABRA, a neural-level architecture.",

Topics covered include stationary and non-stationary stochastic processes, autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) models, state-space models and the Kalman filter, forecasting and forecast evaluation, and an outline of spectral techniques. We also cover deep neural networks relevant to TS data, including RNN and LSTM. Course activities include programming and analytical assignments, a term project with a presentation, and exams.",

Putting those two concepts together, however, is a recent phenomenon which has created a set of intriguing challenges. What is \u2018open data?\u2019 What does it mean to \u2018share\u2019 data? Who makes such policies and how are they implemented? Do data policies look the same all over the world? What are the economic, cultural, and technological implications/impacts of/on a given data policy? How would one even go about understanding and evaluating a data policy?

The goal is to algorithmically develop these methods, and in the process teach the underlying simulation techniques. Applications to realistic problems will highlight the strengths of these approaches, while stressing the challenges that still need to be surmounted.",

This will be a hands-on course in which you apply the tools studied to actual business cases. We will cover analytical techniques typically bundled under \u201cmarketing analytics\u201d such as regression, cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, logit model, conjoint analysis, bass model, etc. We will NOT be approaching these topics theoretically, that is, via equations or proofs. Instead, we\u2019ll learn how and when to apply each model and what they tell marketers.",
