# TRRAM: The Retro Registration Autonomous Manifesto

## hackrpi2025

### Introduction

TRRAM is a web platform designed to help RPI students navigate course registration, understand degree requirements, and build personalized four-year academic plans. The system aims to integrate data scraped from the school's course catalog, major requirement pages (successful), RateMyProfessor, and the school Student Information System (SIS) to generate tailored recommendations.

### Features

1. **Major-Specific Course Guidance (in-progress)**
    - Displays required courses for each major or concentration
    - Provides recommended sequencing based on prerequisites and program structure
    - Highlights prerequisite chains, co-requisites, and courses with limited availability

2. **Registration Assistance (soon)**
    - Suggests courses to take each semester based on progress and requirements
    - Shows instructor comparisons using RateMyProfessors data
    - Enables filtering by difficulty, rating, requirement category, and availability

3. **Integrated Scraped Data**
    - Course catalog: descriptions, credits, scheduling, prerequisites
    - Major requirement trees: cores, electives, distributions
    - RateMyProfessors: instructor ratings and feedback (soon)
    - SIS data: course offerings and semester availability (only when permitted by institutional policy) (soon)

4. **Personalized Four-Year Planning**
    - Auto-generates a four-year plan based on the selected major
    - Allows drag-and-drop reordering of courses across semesters (soon)
    - Tracks progress toward graduation requirements in real time (soon)

5. **Interest-Based Elective Recommendations**
    - Suggests electives based on interests expressed by the student
    - Identifies themes and clusters of courses related to selected interests
    - Recommends courses outside the major that match student goals

6. **Minor and Dual Major Suggestions**
    - Analyzes requirement overlap to propose viable minors or second majors (soon)
    - Estimates additional credits needed and earliest completion timeline
    - Integrates minor/dual-major paths into the four-year plan

### System Overview

#### Data Scraper
- Scrapes course catalog information
- Extracts degree requirements and credit hours by major
- Collects instructor and course reviews from RateMyProfessors
- Normalizes all scraped data into a unified JSON schema

#### Backend API
- Serves course, requirement, and recommendation data
- Manages user plans, progress, and preference saving
- Includes logic for prerequisite resolution and course sequencing

#### Frontend Web Application
- Searchable course database
- Four-year plan builder
- Major/minor comparison interface
- Registration suggestion dashboard
- Tech Stack:
    1. Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
    2. Backend: Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI)
    3. Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
    4. Scraping: Python (BeautifulSoup, Requests, Selenium)
    5. Deployment: Vercel, Netlify, AWS, or Docker

### Program Stucture

1. Scraper
```
rpi_courses # Has the RPICourses scraping setup by Jeff Hui, modified by us
|--parser
    |--course_catalog.py   # functions to iterate through the RPI course catalog
    |--program_features.py  # specifically for the programs page in the course catalog
    |__features.py         # used for XML files
|--sis_parser (inactive)
|--config.py               # subject codes
|--models.py               # supposed to store read-only schedules
|--scheduler.py            # similar to the SIS scheduling system
|--utils.py
|__web.py                  # goes web scraping
masterListScraper.py  # Main implementation of the course scraping software
normalize_courses.py  # Parses words to fit data tables
normalized_courses.json
rpi_courses.json
rpi_program_requirements.json
```

2. Backend Setup
```
node_modules
dataloader.py
db.js
schema.sql
programs_schema.sql
plannerLogic.js  # 4-year planner
package.json
package-lock.json
test.py   # Checking courses
server.js  # Backend program scraper
programLoader.py  # Storing programs into json file
normalized_courses.json
normalized_programs.json
```

2. Frontend Setup
```
index.html   # Website interactive html
CNAME   # Website name
```

### Data Use and Compliance
Before scraping or integrating data, confirm compliance with:
- Institutional Terms of Service
- Robots.txt guidelines for external sites
- Policies governing SIS or internal academic systems
- Do not collect or store student-identifiable information.
- Avoid scraping authenticated SIS content unless explicitly permitted.

### Roadmap
-This program is not currently functional. We utilized local databases, and were unable to link that using a server to the frontend properly, which is our first step for further development as we didn't have enough debugging time in 24 hours! What will work when you open http://trram.tech/ is just the frontend with placeholders.
- Add multi-major planning support
- Integrate schedule conflict detection
- Expand elective recommendation model
- Enable exporting plans to PDF and calendars
- Add user authentication and cloud data syncing

### Contributing
